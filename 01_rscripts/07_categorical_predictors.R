# Unfortunately, regressions (and other models) cannot "deal" with categorical
# predictors; Instead, they require all the predictors to be numerical. The way
# to deal with this is to code categorical variables as a series of numerical
# variables that together encode all the information in the categorical
# variable. These are usually called "dummy variables", as each one alone only
# tells part of the story.
#
# Let's see how we do this in R.







# (1) Model Fitting -------------------------------------------------------



## Adding dummy variables (manually) ---------------------------------------

# Option 1: The SPSS way - make the dummy vars by hand...

anxiety_adhd <- anxiety_adhd |>
  mutate(d_placebo = ifelse(treat_group == "placebo", 1, 0),
         d_treat   = ifelse(treat_group == "treat",   1, 0))


fit_dummy <- lm(anxiety ~ d_placebo + d_treat,
                data = anxiety_adhd)

model_parameters(fit_dummy)
# what do these parameters mean?




## Adding dummy variables (automagically) ----------------------------------
# Option 2: let R do all the hard work... Just put the factor in the formula!

fit_factor <- lm(anxiety ~ treat_group, data = anxiety_adhd)
model_parameters(fit_factor)
model_parameters(fit_dummy)



# How does R determine what and how to dummy-code?
# If `X` is a factor, treatment coding is used, with the FIRST level as the base
# group.
#
# If `X` is a character vactor, it is first converted into a factor (level order
# is alphabetical).

# see the coding scheme:
contrasts(anxiety_adhd$treat_group)




## Change contrast scheme --------------------------------------------------

## 1. change base group in dummy coding
anxiety_adhd$treat_group <- relevel(anxiety_adhd$treat_group, ref = "placebo")
contrasts(anxiety_adhd$treat_group)

fit_factor2 <- lm(anxiety ~ treat_group, data = anxiety_adhd)
model_parameters(fit_factor2)

# Or change the first level of the factor by re-leveling the factor...
# (`forcats` is a good package for working with factors)




## 2. change to effects coding:
# Another popular coding scheme is the effects coding, where the "base group" is
# the AVERAGE of all the groups (so the first contrast is the difference between
# the mean of group 1 and the total mean, etc). Unfortunately, it makes
# parameter interpretation quite hard...
contrasts(anxiety_adhd$treat_group) <- contr.sum
contrasts(anxiety_adhd$treat_group)

fit_factor3 <- lm(anxiety ~ treat_group, data = anxiety_adhd)
model_parameters(fit_factor3) # what do there mean???



?contr.treatment # even more types...
# We can also use weighted effect coding with the {wec} package.





# (2) Model exploration (inference) ---------------------------------------

# Looking at the parameters from the last two models, it is hard to see what the
# difference between "no treat" and "treat" groups is... And even if we could
# fish it out, is it significant?
model_parameters(fit_factor2)
model_parameters(fit_factor3)

# If we were working in SPSS, we would re-fit the model with different dummy
# coding to get all the pair-wise differences.
#
# But we are in R! And we have smart packages that can do wonders!


library(emmeans)
# `emmeans` is one of the best packages in R - for ANY follow-up analysis!!
emmeans(fit_factor2, ~ treat_group)
emmeans(fit_factor3, ~ treat_group)
# Note that both returned the exact same results - the coding scheme has no
# influence here!



# All pair-wise comparisons.
emmeans(fit_factor2, ~ treat_group) |>
  contrast(method = "pairwise",
           infer = TRUE)
# Note the automatic p-value adjustment
# (We will see more complex contrasts when we learn about ANOVAs.)




# This is the time to note that in R, model ~fitting~ and ~hypothesis testing~
# are not as closely knit as they are in SPSS. Whereas in SPSS we would fit
# several models with different dummy coding or variable centering, in R we work
# in 2 stages:
# 1) fit a model
# 2) Ask the model questions - test contrasts / effects of interest, get
#   predictions...
#
# This 2-part method makes life A LOT EASIER once models become more and more
# complex...
